# Ultima IX: Redemption for Morrowind and OpenMW, Libre Edition

This is an attempt to make a Free and Open Source release of the assets used to create 
Ultima IX: Redemption. With these releases, you are free to use the models, meshes and animations
to create, remix and build your own simulations, games or worlds.

## Methodology and Release Guidelines

We are curating the original UIX:R release and validating that none of the assets used contain 
Bethesda's intellectual property (IP) and copyrights. We then search for the original creator of
the work and ask their permission to apply or otherwise re-license to a Creative Common License
of their choice.

## Available CC licenses

Currently 100% of the assets available fall under the CC0 license, otherwise known as the 
"Public Domain" license for jurisdictions that don't honour the concept of "Public Domain".

As more content creators are contacted, they can pick a CC license that bests suites them.

## People you should thank:

Alain "Spyder" Brunotte, released over a 1000 assets
