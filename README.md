# Ultima IX: Redemption for Morrowind, Libre Edition

This is an attempt to make a Libre Edition (LE) release of the assets used to create 
Ultima IX: Redemption. With this LE release, you are free to use the models, meshes and animations
to create, remix and build your own simulations, games and worlds.

## Methodology and Release Guidelines

We are curating the original UIX:R release and validating that none of the assets in the LE contain 
Bethesda's Intellectual Property (IP) and Copyrights. We then try to make contact with the original 
creator of the work. We then ask their permission to add their work to the LE release by having them 
release or re-license their work to a Creative Common License of their choice.

## Available CC licenses

Currently 100% of the assets found in the LE fall under the CC0 license, otherwise known as the 
"Public Domain" license for jurisdictions that don't honour the concept of "Public Domain".

  - CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

As more content creators are contacted, they can pick a CC license that bests suites them.

### What does CC0 mean?

You may freely download, build upon, enhance and reuse the works for any purposes without 
restriction under copyright or database law.

## People you should thank

Alain "Spyder" Brunotte, released over a 1300 assets under the CC0 license.
