# Ultima IX: Redemption for Morrowind, Libre Edition

This is an attempt to make a Libre Edition (LE) release of the assets used to create
Ultima IX: Redemption. With this LE release, you are free to use the models, meshes and animations
to create, remix and build your own simulations, games and worlds.

## Methodology and Release Guidelines

We are curating the original UIX:R release and validating that none of the assets in the LE contain
Bethesda's Intellectual Property (IP) and Copyrights. We then try to make contact with the original
creator of the work. We then ask their permission to add their work to the LE release by having them
release or re-license their work to a Creative Common License of their choice.

## Available CC licenses

Currently 100% of the assets found in the LE fall under either the CC0 or CC-BY license.

As more content creators are contacted, they can pick a CC license that bests suites them.

### CC0
CC0 is also known as the "Public Domain" license for jurisdictions that don't honour the concept 
of "Public Domain". You may freely download, build upon, enhance and reuse the works for any
purposes without restriction under copyright or database law.

  - CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
  
### CC-BY
CC-BY is a license which only stipulates that you include the original author's name with
the work, including all derived work.

  - CC-BY https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

## People you should thank

Alain "Spyder" Brunotte, released over a 1300 assets under the CC0 license. Spyder wrote:

    As for the license: Sure, go for CC0 "public domain". It felt strange that my name was not
    even mentioned once when Corv released the UIX:R files, but I actually do not need my name
    under these assets. I consider them as pieces of my learning process and many are quite messy ;)

Star Boi and his 828 assets under the CC-BY license as he wrote:

    All persons are free to use these meshes as they see fit, keeping in mind that if used in
    another released mod, you should give me credit in the readme, but of course that wont be
    enforced, but it would be nice ^_^ Besides that, do as you will!
